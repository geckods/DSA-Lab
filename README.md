# DSA-Lab
## My solutions for DSA (CS F211) Lab at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus, Semester 2, 2018-2019.
Solutions are mostly self explanatory. 

If you found the solutions helpful, **please star this repository**, it would be much appreciated.

If you need help understanding something, or in case of any clarifications, contact me at f20171176@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in.

I put my best effort into making these solutions correct and complete, but I cannot guarantee their correctness/completeness, and **I am  not liable for any misunderstanding and/or loss of marks** that may result from referring to this repository.

## Update 15.3.22:
It's been over 3 years since I first uploaded my lab sheet solutions, and in that time I forgot about this repository. It's recently come to my attention that the DSA course at Pilani is still using the same set of lab sheets, and that current students are still using this repository as a reference: on March 1st 2022, this repo had nearly 2000 views from 168 viewers. 

### PLAGIARISM NOTICE
#### Please do not directly copy and submit my code.
I want to emphasize that I **do not endorse plagiarism**. Back when I took DSA, the lab sheets were non-evaluative components, so I uploaded the solutions just to help people out: but not for people to copy from them.

Since 20+ people have already forked this repo, there's no point in me taking down the code (since the forks will still persist). But I have added a license which prohibits using this codebase without reproducing the license: so it would be considered [copyright infringement](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/5957/is-there-any-license-that-prohibits-copying-the-code-for-assignment), as well as plagiarism, to directly use parts of this repo.

Plagiarism is not only unethical, but it also defeats the purpose of learning. The only way to learn a subject like DSA well is to write your own code and solve lots of problems from websites like Codeforces. You don't gain anything by copying code: trust me when I say that in the long run, the marks are not worth plagiarising for, no matter how appealing it looks in the moment.

Please use this repo to learn and to experiment. Use it as a guide, but not as a solution set. Write your own code!
